DESCRIPTION
UrlCrazy is for the study of domainname typos / url hijacking.

It generates domainname typo permutations then tests them to learn if they are in use, estimates their popularity and more.


TYPES OF TYPOS SUPPORTED
Character Omission.
These typos are created by leaving out a letter of the domain name, one letter at a time. For example, www.goole.com and www.gogle.com

Adjacent Character Swap.
These typos are created by swapping the order of adjacent letters in the domain name. For example, www.googel.com and www.ogogle.com

Adjacent Character Replacement.
These typos are created by replacing each letter of the domain name with letters to the immediate left and right on the keyboard. For example, www.googke.com and www.goohle.com

Adjacent Character Insertion.
These typos are created by inserting letters to the immediate left and right on the keyboard of each letter. For example, www.googhle.com and www.goopgle.com

Missing Dot.
These typos are created by omitting a dot from the domainname. For example, wwwgoogle.com and www.googlecom

Strip Dashes.
These typos are created by omitting a dash from the domainname. For example, www.domain-name.com becomes www.domainname.com

Singular or Pluralise.
These typos are created by making a singular domain plural and vice versa. For example, www.google.com becomes www.googles.com and www.trademe.co.nz becomes www.trademes.co.nz



DOMAIN TESTS
Is the domain valid?
--------------------
UrlCrazy has a database of valid top level and second level domains. This information has been compiled from wikipedia and domain registrars. We know whether a domain is valid by checking if it matches toplevel and second level domains. For example, www.trademe.co.bz is a valid domain in Belize which allows any second level domain registrations but www.trademe.xo.nz isn't because xo.nz isn't an allowed second level domain in New Zealand.

Popularity Estimate
-------------------
We can estimate the relative popularity of a typo by measuring how often that typo has been made on webpages. Querying cuil.com for the number of search results for a typo gives us a indication of how popular a typo is.

The drawback of this approach is that you need to manually identify and omit legitimate domains such as googles.com

For example, consider the following typos for google.com.
25424 gogle.com
24031 googel.com
22490 gooogle.com
19172 googles.com
19148 goole.com
18855 googl.com
17842 ggoogle.com
16490 googe.com
16367 googgle.com
15029 google.cm
14773 gogole.com
13227 googlle.com
11646 googlee.com
11345 googlr.com
7417 foogle.com
6132 hoogle.com
5313 googlw.com
5208 giogle.com
5151 googke.com
4838 goigle.com
4662 ogogle.com
4630 gopgle.com
4415 goofle.com
4118 wwwgoogle.com
3894 goohle.com
3399 gooigle.com
2675 gfoogle.com
1942 googlecom.com
1534 gopogle.com
1356 googfle.com
1089 googhle.com
892 googlew.com
747 googlke.com
618 goiogle.com
614 goopgle.com
413 ghoogle.com
341 goolge.com
232 googler.com
228 gpogle.com

IP Address
-------------------
If the typo domainname is in use Urlcrazy displays the IP it resolves to. An IP repeating for multiple typos or IPs in a close range shows common ownership. For example, gogle.com, gogole.com and googel.com all resolve to 64.233.161.104 which is owned by Google.
